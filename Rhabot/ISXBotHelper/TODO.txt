(warlock) need an option in the class area to specifiy to use Health Funnel to heal pet and what level to start to heal

(warlock) On the combat tab the program is not advancing past the Pull Spell box. I put Shadow Bolt in that box and had several things in the combat spam box. All that would happen is it started spaming shadow bolt. So I changed it to imoliate in the pull box and shadow bolt in the combat spam and all that was done in combat was imoliate over and over again and never threw one shadow bolt. I know you are getting sick of all my posts but I just want to let you know what i'm seeing.

	For Beta 2:
		move Start/Stop functions to a public class. If we call Stop, it should raise the event AND close the float form
			- needs to use invoke to close form
		ability to logout and back in
		SushiBot - run to mailbox when bags full, then return to water (for autonav only)
		
		Allow the users to list "always attack" mob names, and "always ignore" mob
			names in a list, allowing for wildcards ( or make the user use RegEx, except then
			you'll have to support that on the forums - or just tell them you don't support
			RegEx and they need to debug their own RegEx ).
			So, I may have the app configured to not attack mobs under level 30, but if I have
			"*snapjaw" on my "always attack" list, and a level 24 "Rabid Snapjaw" paths near, I'll still attack it.  
			Same for the ignore list.
